Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
BST :
Average Case
insert - O(log n)
search - O(log n)
delete - O(log n)

Worst Case
insert - O(n)
search - O(n)
delete - O(n)

Provide justification for how your observer subject pattern works

I added 2 variables to store observers in the node class to make updates to that particular node which is replica of the original node.
So when inserting a node to an original tree I am cloning two more nodes and then setting observer node to those two variables of original node.
Whenever a certain node is being deleted I am making call to notifyall method which simply notifies the nodes which are observer of node i.e. course to be deleted.
Notifyall method then calls the update method with the parameters. Those parameters are the observers of node cources I am going to delete.
Values of course from the original tree node are copied to linked observer nodes.
